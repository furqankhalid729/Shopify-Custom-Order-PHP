Laravel Shopify Order Processing System
This project integrates Laravel with the Shopify PHP library to handle order creation directly from the Shopify Admin panel. It features a zip code validation system that ensures only orders with valid zip codes are processed.

Key Features:
Zip Code Validation: When a user submits an order through the Shopify store, the system validates the zip code against a pre-defined list of valid zip codes.
Order Processing: If the zip code is valid, the order is successfully created and processed in Shopify.
Error Handling: If the zip code is invalid, the order is canceled, and the user is redirected to an error page with appropriate messaging.
This application ensures smooth, automated order processing with robust zip code validation for better customer experience and fraud prevention.
